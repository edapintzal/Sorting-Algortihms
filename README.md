## Sorting Algorithms Comparison: Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort

### Overview
This assignment involves implementing and comparing the performance of four sorting algorithms:
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

The algorithms will be tested on datasets of varying sizes (1K, 10K, and 100K) and types (random, increasing-order, and decreasing-order integers). The goal is to analyze their efficiency under different conditions.

Hardware Specifications Affecting Sorting Performance:
* CPU: Intel Core i7-12700H, 14 cores (6P + 8E), 20 threads
* GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050
* RAM: 16 GB total, 4.74 GB available
* Virtual Memory: 21.1 GB total, 8.26 GB available
* Disk Page File: 5.50 GB (C:\pagefile.sys)
* System Type: 64-bit OS, x64-based processor
* Boot Mode: UEFI
* Likely Storage Type: SSD (TF Gaming series)

For insertion sort it works best when the input size is at least and increased ordered. And it works
worst when the input size is the biggest and inputs are decreased ordered.
For merge sort best is when the input size is at least and decreased ordered. Worst one is when input
size is the biggest and inputs are random ordered.
For heap sort best is when the input size is at least and inputs are decreasing ordered. Worst one is
when input size is the biggest and inputs are random ordered.
For quick sort best is when the input size is at least and inputs are random ordered. Worst one is when
input size is the biggest and the inputs are increasing ordered.
